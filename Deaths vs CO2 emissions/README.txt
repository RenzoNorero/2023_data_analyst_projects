In this project, I make an analysis using data from OCDE countries through the years. Specifically, we relate some deaths
causes with the emissions of greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent. 

- First, we worked a bit in Excel to modifiy the data and make it more python-friendly:
	* Deleted unnecesary columns.
	* Rename columns to avoid compatibility issues.
	* Pivot data for make a temporal analysis.
- Then we worked on Python to create our new datasets based on the data we want to center our analysis:
	* Using Jupyter Notebooks we create different datasets (Pandas).
	* We make some correlation analysis.
- Finally, we create a dashboard in Tableau, in which you can alter the year and the cause of death, and see  top and bottom
countries in deaths each 100k habitants for that cause of death, a scatter plot with all OCDE countries, relating that cause of death and CO2 emissions, and a trend that ilustrates the correlation between them for a specific country.
